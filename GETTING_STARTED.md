## 📦 Step 2: Install Backend Dependencies (3 minutes)

### Open PowerShell and run:

```powershell
# Navigate to backend folder
cd "d:\Projects\Furniture Recomendation Model\backend"

# Install Python packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Expected output:**
```
Collecting fastapi==0.104.1

## 🚀 Step 3: Start Backend Server (1 minute)

### In the same PowerShell window:

```powershell
# Make sure you're in backend folder
cd "d:\Projects\Furniture Recomendation Model\backend"

# Start the server
python api.py
```

**Expected output:**
```
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)

npm run dev
```

**Expected output:**
```
  VITE v5.0.8  ready in 523 ms

## 🛠️ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Port 8000 already in use
```powershell
# Find and kill the process
netstat -ano | findstr :8000
Stop-Process -Id <PID> -Force

# Or use different port
cd backend
uvicorn api:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001

# Update frontend/.env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8001
```

### Issue: Products not loading
1. Check backend is running (http://localhost:8000/api/health)
2. Check browser console (F12) for errors
3. Verify frontend/.env has: `VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000`
4. Restart both servers

### Issue: CORS errors
Backend should already have CORS configured, but if you see errors:
1. Check `backend/api.py` has `allow_origins=["*"]` in development
2. Restart backend server

### Issue: npm install fails
```powershell
# Clear cache and reinstall
cd frontend
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force node_modules
Remove-Item package-lock.json
npm cache clean --force
npm install
```

- **Frontend changes**: Vite HMR updates instantly
- **CSS changes**: Updates without page reload
- **Config changes**: May need server restart

### Performance
- Backend responds in < 100ms
- Frontend initial load < 2s
- Search results update instantly
- Charts render smoothly

## 🎓 Understanding the Application

### How Search Works
1. User types query (e.g., "laptop")
2. Frontend sends request to `/api/recommend?query=laptop`
3. Backend calculates relevance scores:
   - Title match: +3 points
   - Description match: +2 points
   - Category match: +2 points
   - Features match: +1 point
4. Backend sorts by score and rating
5. Frontend displays results

### How Analytics Work
1. User clicks "Analytics" tab
2. Frontend requests `/api/analytics`
3. Backend analyzes all products:
   - Counts products, brands, categories
   - Calculates price statistics
   - Groups by price ranges
   - Generates distribution data
4. Frontend renders charts with Recharts
5. User can toggle dark mode
